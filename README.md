Great question. Given that you’re a Product Manager hiring a Project Manager, it’s essential to define clear roles, boundaries, and collaboration dynamics between the two. Here’s a crisp breakdown:

⸻

Role of the Project Manager (Reporting to Product Manager)

Primary Responsibility: Ensure the execution of the product roadmap on time, within scope and budget.

What the Product Manager (You) Should Own – Not the Project Manager

Based on Joseph Wong’s Resume

He looks like a delivery-oriented senior project manager with:
	•	Wealth/fintech domain depth.
	•	Strong experience across Agile ceremonies, enterprise client mgmt, migration planning.
	•	Ability to coordinate multi-stakeholder programs and vendor relationships.

He’d be well suited to:

	•	Free you up to focus more on strategy, user discovery, and executive stakeholder mgmt.

Let me know if you’d like a template for a responsibility matrix (RACI) or a sample onboarding plan for this project manager.

The Index Analytics Product and Development Team, comprised of cross-functional experts in index strategy, engineering, and analytics, came together to deliver a scalable platform that supports institutional workflows around index events. In a short timeframe, the team successfully collaborated to define product requirements, validate data from multiple index providers, and build a robust entitlement and feature framework. The team contributed to end-to-end delivery — from prototyping and testing to data enforcement, entitlement logic, and user access control. Their deep subject matter expertise and shared sense of ownership ensured the delivery of a solution that is secure, precise, and aligned with institutional client needs. The platform has become a foundation for related analytics tools and has strengthened our digital product footprint across global markets.


What impact did their actions have on our clients, partners, and peers?
The team’s work on Index Analytics significantly enhanced how institutional clients consume and act on index event data. By delivering insights through multiple channels — including the digital platform and a tailored subscription-based email service — the solution met clients where they were, improving accessibility and engagement across a broad user base. This multi-modal delivery approach supported onboarding for high-value Focus 40 clients and deepened adoption across Global Markets teams. Internally, the team’s ownership mindset and ability to operate across roles inspired a heightened level of collaboration and energy. Their success set a new benchmark for how cross-functional teams can deliver client-centric, data-rich products in dynamic markets.


How have their behaviours and activities consistently gone "above and beyond" the normal expectations of your nominees (or team’s) role and day-to-day accountabilities?
What set this team apart was not just the delivery — but how they operated throughout. The Index Analytics team embraced ambiguity, stepped outside functional boundaries, and adopted a true builder mindset. Many team members took on new responsibilities — such as product scoping, workflow testing, entitlement design, and user enablement — often for the first time. Rather than staying within traditional swim lanes, they demonstrated a deep sense of ownership and accountability across the entire product lifecycle. This wasn't a one-time effort; it marked a shift in how the team works — collaborative, adaptive, and focused on delivering long-term impact. It's a clear embodiment of the #OneRBC spirit, where teams think beyond roles to build what matters.

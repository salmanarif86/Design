How Can I Use MATA?
Trading Scenario: Preparing for a Major Index Rebalance Before It's Official

As a portfolio manager, you can’t afford to wait for the official announcement to start preparing for a major index rebalance. With MATA’s Rebalance Watchlist, you get a head start—enabling you to anticipate potential changes and plan your execution strategy days or even weeks ahead.

Here are the top 3 things I’d look at in MATA if I had to rebalance in a week and the announcement hasn’t dropped yet:

Who’s Likely In or Out?
The Potential Actions table gives you a preview of possible additions and deletions, based on market cap trends and index methodology rules. For example, if names like APP or DASH are showing up as probable additions with meaningful weights, that’s a signal to start risk-managing your exposure.

How Much Might I Have to Trade?
The Estimated Shares to Trade and Net Buy/Sell (Shares) columns help size the trade. These are modeled using index weight projections and outstanding shares—giving me an early read on how much demand or supply might come into the name, and how long it could take to get it done.

How Hard Will This Be to Execute?
The Days to Trade estimate gives a simple but powerful view of execution difficulty. A name showing 20+ days to trade signals potential liquidity constraints or execution risk. I’d start discussing these names with the desk early to avoid scrambling later.

Bonus: I can run a Pre-Trade Cost Estimate to simulate the impact of trading each name under different liquidity assumptions—helping me prioritize which names to get ahead of.

Even if the rebalance hasn’t been announced, I’m already working from a position of strength—armed with directional conviction and size awareness, so I can act as soon as the news drops (or even slightly before the crowd).

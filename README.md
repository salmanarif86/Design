The Opportunity:

We're looking for a Senior Product Manager to lead the vision, strategy, and execution of our Trade Analytics platform within Capital Markets. You'll be at the center of one of the firm’s most high-leverage product bets—reimagining how institutional clients interact with analytics, data, and insights across asset classes.

This role isn’t about incremental feature delivery. It’s about creating leverage at scale—by designing digital-first workflows, simplifying complex client journeys, and unlocking new channels for engagement and growth. You’ll partner with Engineering, Quants, Traders, Compliance, and Sales to define how our analytics ecosystem evolves over time.

If you thrive on solving ambiguous, high-stakes problems in enterprise finance—and want to shape the future of digital capital markets—this is the role for you.

What You’ll Own:

End-to-end product ownership of the Trade Analytics platform—from zero-to-one bets to scaling mature products across digital channels.

Set product vision and multi-quarter roadmaps, deeply aligned with business outcomes (e.g. revenue growth, channel expansion, client engagement).

Partner with internal teams to build intuitive, self-serve analytics tools that reduce complexity and drive adoption.

Define the measurement framework—track product success via customer behavior, usage, and commercial impact.

Lead strategy for digitization of client experience in capital markets—simplifying trade workflows, onboarding, and insights delivery.

Shape the product’s go-to-market and customer success motions with Sales and Marketing.

What You Bring:

10+ years in product management or adjacent roles, with at least 5 in fintech, capital markets, or enterprise data products.

Proven track record of building and scaling data platforms or analytics products used by demanding professional clients.

Systems thinker who can navigate across technical teams (Engineering, Quants), commercial leaders (Sales, Traders), and compliance.

Experience building digital-first B2B workflows across asset classes (e.g., equities, FX, fixed income).

Strong decision-making under ambiguity; equally comfortable refining a prototype or pitching to leadership.

High agency, low ego. You own outcomes, not just roadmaps.

Why Join Us:

You’ll work on a high-visibility platform with direct impact on revenue and client experience.

Access to deep domain experts across trading, data science, and engineering.

Competitive compensation, flexible work, and a mandate to innovate within a global bank.

🔄 Delta: Interview-Informed Adjustments to Davis E. Persona
🧾 About
Additions:

Davis plays a hybrid role that spans business development, financial modeling, and client presentations — this came through more clearly in the transcript.

He's the owner and long-time maintainer of the Access-based deal database (not just a user).

More involved than previously implied in storyboarding and conceptual narrative design, not just QA.

🧠 Attitudes & Behaviors
✅ Expanded or Refined Themes:
Narrative-First, But Iterative: Stronger emphasis on live, collaborative idea development vs. static templates. Whiteboarding is central to how ideas are born.

Strong belief in physical artifacts: He prints decks, lays them out, and rearranges them like puzzle pieces — a nuance that wasn't fully captured before.

AI = Speed, Not Substance: Will accept AI for idea scaffolding, QA, and “sharpy-to-slide” conversion — but emphasizes the VP’s role as narrative translator can’t be fully outsourced.

Teaching Culture: Highlights intern involvement in live strategy sessions — points to a mentorship orientation, not captured before.

❌ Frictions & Unmet Needs
🔍 New or Deepened Pain Points:
Manual idea-to-slide conversion from whiteboard sessions is a huge drag (“Sharpy → PowerPoint” takes hours).

Final QA pain is worse than expected — especially for 80+ page books. Bracket errors, comp mismatches, and regional slip-ups are common.

CRM integration gap is more risky than previously indicated. There's real concern about Access being deprecated and data loss.

Storyline drift risk during production is high. Needs better alignment between early intent and final deck version.

✅ Opportunities
🚀 Enhanced Opportunities Identified:
AI-generated multiple draft page layouts (not just one) to give MDs choice and speed alignment.

Aiden Note-Taker → Outline Generator: Capturing whiteboard/meeting notes and turning them into structured pitchbook outlines.

CRM-AI Fusion: Auto-tag deals, extract relevant comps, and recall past pitch materials tied to a client.

Live QA Bot for final deck review — scanning for placeholder text, misalignments, and formatting errors before print.

Personalized idea prompts based on past deal patterns or client history (he hinted at wanting something “dynamic and contextual”).

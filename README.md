Hi team,

Sharing an article that really clarified something I’ve been sensing but hadn’t articulated until now.

Pete Koomen (co-founder of Optimizely) draws a sharp analogy: we’re building “AI horseless carriages” — interfaces that bolt GenAI onto old workflows, instead of reimagining what AI-native experiences should look like.

He uses Gmail's Gemini as a cautionary tale — not because it lacks functionality, but because it reinforces patterns that don't take full advantage of what AI can do. The piece doesn’t just critique; it reframes how we might think about control, customization, and the deeper job AI is actually good at: transformation over generation.

It’s a short read, but I think it will sharpen how we approach our own product design conversations.

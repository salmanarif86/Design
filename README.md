Hi team,

Thanks again for pulling together the discussion guide for our upcoming interview with RBC bankers. I’ve had a chance to review the list, and it’s great to see how much ground we’re aiming to cover.

Given that we’ll only have around one hour with each participant, I thought it might be helpful for us to regroup and reflect on a few things together before we go in:

Prioritization: With 45 questions across multiple themes, can we quickly identify the 8–10 highest priority questions we want to be sure to cover in the time available?

Clarity & Framing: A few of the questions could benefit from tighter framing so that we can avoid hypotheticals or overly open-ended prompts and instead anchor more on real examples, behaviors, and past decisions.
  Example: Question 45 – “What do you feel will be the most valuable area to leverage GenAI in your client services work?”
This could be reframed to something more behavioral and grounded, e.g., “Have you ever tried using GenAI in your client services workflow? What happened?”

AI-Specific Prompts: For the GenAI-related section, perhaps we can flag what we most want to learn (e.g., trust, usability, perceived value), so we don’t over-index on tooling questions without context.
Example: Question 35 – “Would you use a tool that helps generate a first draft of a deck?”
Before asking this, should we first understand whether they trust automated outputs in general (as in Q42)? That may help us frame this better and avoid abstract speculation.




Absolutely — you can either propose strong GenAI use cases directly or help them build the right mental model to uncover use cases themselves (“teach them to fish”). Here’s a two-part approach:

⸻

✅ Part 1: Strong GenAI Use Cases for FX and Sales Teams

1. Market Commentary Synthesizer
	•	Trigger: Economic data release or major market move
	•	GenAI Role: Summarize RBC macro strategist view, overlay market movement, generate tiered client-ready emails (by client sophistication)
	•	Impact: Reduces time from event to client communication from hours to minutes

2. Portfolio-aware Outreach
	•	Trigger: Client portfolio includes interest-rate sensitive positions or unhedged exposures
	•	GenAI Role: Scan holdings + news + strategy notes → generate personalized nudge (“client X likely exposed to CAD weakness, consider hedging forward”)
	•	Impact: Turns static CRM data into proactive, relevant touchpoints

3. Email & Chat Response Accelerator
	•	Trigger: Incoming client email (e.g., “What’s your view on EUR/USD this week?”)
	•	GenAI Role: Draft smart reply based on latest RBC views, trader inputs, and CRM context
	•	Impact: Saves time, raises consistency, and scales personalization

4. Voice-to-Insight Assistant
	•	Trigger: Salesperson voice-memos insight after client call
	•	GenAI Role: Transcribes → tags topic + urgency + next steps → updates CRM and suggests follow-up email
	•	Impact: Streamlines workflow, improves coverage tracking

🧠 Part 2: Teach Them to “Fish” for Use Cases

Use a framework-based approach so teams can uncover use cases naturally. Here’s a lightweight version you can bring to a workshop:

⸻

⚙️ The 4C GenAI Use Case Framework

Area	Ask This…	GenAI Opportunity
Content	Do you repeat writing the same kind of content?	Auto-generate emails, commentary, summaries
Context	Do you spend time gathering info from many places?	Use RAG to surface the right data fast
Conversation	Are you answering similar client questions often?	Auto-draft answers, internal Q&A bots
Coordination	Is time lost updating systems or logging notes?	Summarize, structure, and sync actions


⸻

👇 Prompts to Ask in a Workshop or 1-on-1
	1.	“What’s the most repetitive part of your job?”
→ Likely GenAI can automate or templatize it.
	2.	“What takes you more than 10 mins that shouldn’t?”
→ Likely GenAI can summarize, search, or classify faster.
	3.	“When do you feel like a ‘translator’—between people or systems?”
→ LLMs shine when you’re converting unstructured to structured or vice versa.
	4.	“What do junior team members ask you over and over?”
→ GenAI FAQ bots, document Q&A, or SOP assistant.

✅ You Could Summarize This in a Slide or One-Pager

Let me know if you’d like this turned into a simple workshop outline or visual slide deck — it could help you seed these ideas across the desk.

Would you like me to draft that?

Scour the internet regularly for news relevant to our client base

“…then surface to salesperson and auto-draft emails to clients (e.g., acquisitions, fundraises)”

	•	GenAI fit: Very strong
	•	Why impactful: Combines web-scraping + LLM summarization + templated email drafting. Frees up a lot of mental bandwidth and creates scalable outbound value.
	•	Bonus: Can prioritize results based on client portfolio, holdings, or preferences.

3. Run automated checks on existing clients

“…which ones are overlevered, underhedged, or not having conversations”

	•	GenAI fit: Moderate to strong
	•	Why impactful: Great for generating natural-language summaries of analytics results (e.g., “Client X has no FX hedge on 90-day forward exposures”). You can also pair this with a rules engine for initial detection.

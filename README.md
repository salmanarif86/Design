:dart: AHA MOMENT 1:
Jason doesn’t fear inefficiency — he fears missing a window to embed RBC at the center of a breakout company’s growth story.

:mag: THE EVIDENCE:

“Our job is to go where I believe revenue is going to be.”
“I maintain a running list… and prioritize my calling efforts around those opportunities.”
“We need to be around those key stakeholders early.”

:zap: IMPLICATION:
AI shouldn’t just streamline tasks — it must act as a proactive opportunity scout, surfacing deals before they’re obvious to the market.

:performing_arts: EMOTIONAL CORE:
Fear of irrelevance. He’s driven by a need to stay close to the heat — to be where value is about to be created, not where it's already recognized.

:bulb: OPPORTUNITY:
Build an “Emerging Momentum Map” — an AI-generated heatmap of fast-scaling companies in his sector, ranked by signals like funding, sentiment, hiring spikes, or consumer buzz.

:dart: AHA MOMENT 2:
Cold outreach isn’t just annoying — it’s a silent credibility killer.

:mag: THE EVIDENCE:

“Biggest pain point is finding the right contact info… validating emails... going through multiple sources.”
“Sometimes you send emails based on what you think the domain is.”

:zap: IMPLICATION:
Wasted time is one issue — but showing up with the wrong name, title, or cold open damages his personal brand with high-value targets.

:performing_arts: EMOTIONAL CORE:
Status anxiety. He’s terrified of looking unprepared or like “just another banker” to elite founders or PE firms.

:bulb: OPPORTUNITY:
Use AI to enrich contact intelligence in real-time — flag mutual connections, recent activity, and warm intro paths. Show “contextual approach suggestions” tailored to each target.

:dart: AHA MOMENT 3:
The pitch book is dead — but he still needs to resurrect it each week.

:mag: THE EVIDENCE:

“Pitchbook process is outdated — 20 years old.”
“We still use slides with font size 8… we should be able to put an iPad on a page.”
“Clients want fun, interactive, and visual storytelling — not wall-of-text decks.”

:zap: IMPLICATION:
Helping bankers make decks faster isn’t enough. The real pain is creating high-stakes emotional engagement in a medium that resists it.

:performing_arts: EMOTIONAL CORE:
Creative frustration. Jason wants to entertain and impress, not just inform. His sector is casual, founder-led — and he needs to mirror that energy.

:bulb: OPPORTUNITY:
An “AI Storyboard Assistant” that translates themes (e.g. “The Taco Trend”) into bold visual concepts, charts, headlines, and even sizzle reels. Output should feel like a TED Talk, not a term sheet.

:dart: AHA MOMENT 4:
Jason’s value isn't what he knows — it's how he frames what clients don’t.

:mag: THE EVIDENCE:

“I benchmark public comps so private companies can see their own story more clearly.”
“What are the KPIs investors care about? I try to pull those out in conversation.”
“I go in not to preach — but to foster a conversation.”

:zap: IMPLICATION:
AI mustn't just surface data — it must equip Jason to lead narrative discovery, teasing out insights that clients haven’t yet articulated.

:performing_arts: EMOTIONAL CORE:
Identity. He sees himself not as a spreadsheet jockey but as a narrative translator between capital markets and visionary founders.

:bulb: OPPORTUNITY:
Create a “Story Delta Engine” — show how a company’s metrics align or deviate from ideal IPO/M&A archetypes, and recommend positioning angles that close the gap.

:dart: AHA MOMENT 5:
He’s willing to work with AI that’s wrong — as long as it’s creative.

:mag: THE EVIDENCE:

“I’m fine if it’s 40–50% accurate... if I can iterate it.”
“Sometimes I just want to talk it out loud and see something visual come to life.”
“If I can submit a slide and say change X, Y, Z, that’s a win.”

:zap: IMPLICATION:
Don’t overinvest in precision. He’s asking for collaboration, not automation — a co-pilot, not a tool.

:performing_arts: EMOTIONAL CORE:
Desire for creative control. He wants to see himself in the final output, not be handed a black-box result.

:bulb: OPPORTUNITY:
Design a voice- or sketch-to-slide tool that allows Jason to “jam” with AI — generating decks by riffing aloud or marking up old pages with intent.

:dart: AHA MOMENT 6:
Even in a bake-off, it’s not the data — it’s the feeling.

:mag: THE EVIDENCE:

“We’re trying to create a presentation that makes people say, ‘Wow, I want to buy this company.’”
“We show clients the same pages we’ll show investors — it’s a dress rehearsal.”
“It’s eye contact. It’s storytelling. Not reading from a deck.”

:zap: IMPLICATION:
AI should help bankers rehearse persuasion, not just compile pages. The emotional arc is as important as the numbers.

:performing_arts: EMOTIONAL CORE:
Persuasive pride. Jason thrives on winning the room with confidence and narrative mastery.

:bulb: OPPORTUNITY:
An AI-powered “pitch preview” mode that simulates investor reactions, flags emotional weak points in the deck, and helps rehearse story arcs.

:dart: AHA MOMENT 7:
What slows him down isn’t data access — it’s fragmented trust.

:mag: THE EVIDENCE:

“I didn’t know we had ZoomInfo… I use my own workaround, but it’s clunky.”
“I still go to Google when other tools fail.”
“I fall back on old ways when I need to move fast.”

:zap: IMPLICATION:
Adoption isn’t about features — it’s about certainty under pressure. If he doubts a tool will deliver when it counts, he won’t even try.

:performing_arts: EMOTIONAL CORE:
Fear of failure. He’s operating in a zero-failure zone — tools must feel reliable under fire, not experimental.

:bulb: OPPORTUNITY:
Build a “trust-first layer” — every AI feature should show source traceability, allow manual override, and offer quick previews of how it's used by peers.

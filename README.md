How Can I Use MATA?
Trading Scenario: Predicting Index Rebalance Impacts Before They're Official

Institutional traders often face sharp moves around index rebalances—especially when changes are only revealed days before implementation. With MATA, you can get ahead of these moves by surfacing likely adds, deletes, and weight shifts before official announcements.

Example Use Case: Anticipating Rebalance Events

Run a MATA Index Analytics Query
→ Navigate to the Index Events tab to explore upcoming rebalance cycles across major indices and view MATA’s predictions based on corporate actions, methodology rules, and historical patterns.

Stay Ahead of Official News
Our models regularly flag high-probability changes days—or even weeks—in advance of provider announcements. This early signal can be crucial for building or exiting positions with better pricing and lower market impact.

Estimate Trading Costs Before Acting
Use the Pre-Trade Analytics tool to estimate the expected cost of executing a rebalance trade. This includes impact by side, volume, and liquidity assumptions—so you can better plan your execution strategy.

Request Prediction Accuracy Reports
While we don’t publish a tracker by default, detailed prediction-versus-actual reports can be provided on request for key rebalance events.

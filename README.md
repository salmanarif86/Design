Absolutely — here’s a restructured layout that aligns with how investment bankers think and prepare, especially when heading into a client call with a company like ServiceNow. The current structure is very data-source-centric (CRM, SEC, Market Data), which fragments the story.

Let’s reframe it around Jobs-To-Be-Done for Bankers, using 5 high-yield sections:

Restructured Layout for Investment Banker Prep

1. Executive Snapshot (High-Level Context)

Goal: Give the banker a 30-second CEO/CFO-ready view.
Cards to include:
	•	Company Overview (condensed to 3 bullets)
	•	Latest Earnings Summary (Q4 miss + EPS/Rev delta)
	•	Market Data: Stock trend + Key investor signals
	•	CRM Highlights (e.g., current relationship tier, banker owner)

2. Strategic Signals

Goal: Help banker spot value creation levers or pain points.
Cards to include:
	•	Equity Research Narrative Drift (what analysts are missing)
	•	CRM Insights (e.g., whitespace, churn risk, wallet share)
	•	Analyst Divergence (e.g., upside vs. bear case logic)
	•	AI and GTM trends (from product/research briefs)

Optional Toggle: “Turn this into a talk track” with banker-friendly 1-liners

3. Deal Exposure + Past Interactions

Goal: Anchor the banker in relationship capital and past motions.
Cards to include:
	•	RBC Relationship Overview (visual map of stakeholders)
	•	Recent Conversations (with internal takeaways flagged)
	•	Past Transactions (bookrunner history, dollar amount, role)
	•	Key Attachments (decks, NDAs, etc. for deal continuity)

4. Advisory Opportunities

Goal: Cue the banker on where they can create commercial or capital value.
Cards to include:
	•	M&A White Space (peers with active deals or tech tuck-ins)
	•	Strategic Gaps (e.g., vertical expansion, GTM enablement)
	•	Capital Markets Triggers (valuation gaps, activist pressure)

Optional Button: “Generate tailored ideas” → dynamically pulls 2–3 opportunities to raise in meeting

5. Red Flags & Compliance

Goal: Ensure the banker avoids risk or regulatory missteps.
Cards to include:
	•	Insider activity / filing alerts
	•	NDA/confidentiality notes
	•	Compliance guardrails if AI or cross-border topics emerge

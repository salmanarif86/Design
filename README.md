Story: Talking Points in Outlook (Desktop)
As a
coverage banker preparing for client meetings
I want to
see auto-generated “Talking Points” based on entitled research, news, and internal notes, with options to tailor for specific personas (e.g., CEO, CFO) and add to my client brief or meeting script
So that
I can quickly prepare focused, role-relevant talking material without manually combing through multiple content sources.

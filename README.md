The success of the Index Analytics initiative is best reflected in the voices of those it serves. Feedback from clients has been overwhelmingly positive — with repeat engagement from top-tier accounts like BlackRock, Vanguard, and Invesco, and a growing roster of active users across regions including Asia-Pacific. As one trader from Invesco noted, “We do see various pre-trade analytics, commentary, etc. from most of our parties, but [this platform] really stands out in its robustness.” Similarly, a BlackRock trader remarked, “Everyone at the desk was impressed by the platform.”

Internally, the team’s work has been just as impactful. As Dylan Reed, Head of Product Strategy, noted: “The index product team… moved heaven and earth to produce a street-leading tool for external and internal users alike. What’s especially impressive has been the efficiency with which they’ve tackled feedback from clients and stakeholders… personifying our commitment to the growth of those relationships and to the overall growth of the index product at RBC.”

These testimonials underscore how the team’s product not only met but exceeded expectations — becoming a strategic asset that continues to build credibility, trust, and commercial impact across the firm.

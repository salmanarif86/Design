Reimagined Intelligent Client Meeting Prep Experience

Overview: Senior bankers need a fluid, contextual, and intelligent briefing system that synthesizes data into decision-ready insights. The current “dynamic” client brief UI is static and data-heavy, forcing bankers to manually sift for meaning. We propose a redesigned experience leveraging Generative AI (GenAI) to deliver a concise executive summary, highlight what’s changed, and provide interactive briefing tools – all in one integrated workflow. The result is a clear, summarized, and actionable client prep dashboard that reflects how senior bankers work and think.

Current client brief interface (ServiceNow example). The existing UI presents many separate data widgets (company overview, SEC filings, CRM notes, news, etc.) without synthesis. It overwhelms users with raw information, requiring manual cross-referencing and making it hard to identify key insights.

1. AI-Synthesized Executive Snapshot

What it is: At the top of the new dashboard, an AI-generated Executive Summary provides a distilled briefing on the client. Rather than a generic overview, this summary is a tailored, up-to-the-minute insight report. It pulls from SEC filings, recent news, and internal CRM notes to highlight the 3 most important priorities or developments for the client.
	•	Key Priorities Example: The system might output bullet points like:
	•	*“Expand AI offerings across platform” – ServiceNow’s filings and press releases emphasize a push into generative AI solutions this quarter.
	•	*“Integrate recent acquisitions” – Successful post-merger integration of Moveworks (acquired Mar 2025) is critical to extending workflow automation features.
	•	*“Drive organic growth via partnerships” – Management indicates no major M&A on horizon; focus on strategic RPA/AI partnerships to fuel growth.

Each priority is backed by source data (with links to the relevant 10-Q excerpt, press release, or CRM note), but presented in plain language for quick grasp. This succinct summary means the banker immediately sees what matters now – without wading through separate widgets. As one industry example notes, GenAI can “generate concise summaries and synopses tailored for senior executives… delivering actionable insights without overwhelming [them] with excessive details” ￼. The AI Snapshot does exactly that: it surfaces actionable intelligence (e.g. product focus, strategic gaps, growth opportunities) so the banker can walk into the meeting knowing where to steer the conversation. Clarity and brevity are paramount – a few key bullets or a short paragraph, not a data dump.

Design: Visually, the Executive Snapshot might appear as a clean, prominent “Briefing Card” at the top of the dashboard. It could use icons or highlights for each priority (e.g. a lightbulb icon for an innovation initiative, an acquisition icon for M&A), making it scannable. A toggle could allow the banker to expand each point for a one-paragraph AI-generated explanation or collapse for just the headline. This section is dynamic – if new material information comes in (a fresh news article or an earnings release), the AI summary updates in real-time. A timestamp and a “Last updated” note assure the user it’s current.

2. Highlights of Changes Since Last Meeting

What it is: Senior bankers care deeply about what’s changed since they last spoke with the client. The new design features a dedicated “Recent Changes” bar that calls out significant updates at a glance. This component automatically compares the current context to the previous meeting’s data (which might be the last saved brief or CRM entry) and flags differences that matter:
	•	Market Changes: “Share price +8% since Feb 2025 meeting” (with an upward arrow icon) or “Stock down 5% since last week on earnings miss.” Key stock or market moves are shown with simple visual cues (green/red arrows), giving instant context on market sentiment.
	•	Financial Updates: “Q1 revenue $2.6B (▲7% QoQ)” – important financial metric changes from the last quarter are highlighted in a small table or badge, so bankers see growth or declines without digging through reports.
	•	Organizational Changes: “New CFO appointed in March” or “Departure of VP Sales (Apr 2025)” – any management shake-ups or org changes (mined from news and CRM logs) are listed. This ensures the banker isn’t caught off-guard if a familiar contact left or a new decision-maker is in play.
	•	Deal & Pipeline Changes: “New deal: ServiceNow announced a $50M partnership with XYZ Corp” – any major corporate events (acquisitions, partnerships, capital raises) since the last meeting are summarized. Internally, if RBC’s deal pipeline with the client changed (e.g. a proposed financing moved stages), that is noted here too.

Design-wise, these highlights could appear as a colored “Since Last Meeting” timeline or panel near the top. Each change might be one line with an icon and brief text, possibly clickable for details. For example, clicking the “Q1 revenue” change could open a mini-chart comparing Q1 vs last Q4 results. This section provides instant situational awareness: in seconds, the banker knows what’s new or different, which is critical for decision readiness. It shifts the focus from static data to delta-focused insight – exactly what a time-strapped senior banker needs before a meeting.

3. Unified Intelligence: All Data in One Context

What it is: The redesigned experience breaks down information silos by combining internal and external intel into a single contextual view. Instead of isolated widgets for SEC filings, CRM insights, news, etc., the system presents a cohesive “Client Briefing Feed” or canvas where related information is interwoven.

In practice, this could look like an interactive briefing document or timeline that merges data sources with AI annotations. For example, a section of the feed might display an excerpt from the latest 10-Q filing (key financial metrics or a quote from management), followed immediately by a short AI-generated summary or insight blurb. Right next to it might be a recent news headline about the company’s product launch, accompanied by a one-sentence AI summary and tagged as “Product Update”. Below that, a snippet from the banker’s last CRM note (“Discussed possible partnerships – client interested in APAC expansion”) could appear, with the date and meeting attendee noted, and perhaps an AI comment like “(Relates to recent Asia expansion news)” to connect the dots.

Everything is in one place – a single scrollable briefing page that the banker can skim top to bottom. The AI acts as a connective tissue, synthesizing and tagging information by theme. It might group items into categories like Strategy, Financials, Competitive Moves, Relationship History, etc., regardless of source. This contextual integration means, for instance, that a press release about a new product feature and an equity research note on the client’s technology both appear in a “Product Strategy” section together. The banker no longer has to mentally integrate five different panels – the system does it for them. Microsoft’s own meeting prep app follows a similar idea: it “brings together external financial data with internal content to create a comprehensive view of a company” ￼. Here, we take it further by presenting that comprehensive view in a narrative, storyboard-like format rather than scattered widgets.

Design: The UI might employ expandable sections or cards within this feed. Each card could represent a topic or data item, labeled clearly (e.g. Earnings Highlights, Recent News, CRM – Last Call). AI-driven smart summaries are displayed prominently, with the raw source available on demand (via a dropdown or “See details” link). For example, the Earnings Highlights card might say: “Subscription revenues up 25% YoY; focus of earnings call was on AI-driven workflow products” ￼, distilled from the 10-Q and earnings call transcript, with a link to view the actual filing snippet if needed. By having everything on one page, a banker can swiftly absorb the narrative of the client’s situation holistically, rather than piecemeal.

4. Dynamic Briefings & GenAI Assistant Tools

What it is: To replace static data widgets, the new experience includes interactive briefing and analysis tools powered by GenAI. This is like having a virtual analyst or “co-pilot” by your side during prep ￼. Key features might include:
	•	One-Click Briefing Generation: A prominent “Generate 3‑Minute Briefing” button lets the banker instantly get a spoken or written briefing of the client. If pressed, the system uses text-to-speech to narrate the executive summary and key updates in about 3 minutes – perfect for a banker who wants to listen on the go. Alternatively, it could produce a written synopsis that the banker can read if they prefer. This briefing isn’t generic; it’s tailored to what’s relevant today (using that AI snapshot and recent changes). Essentially, it’s an on-demand prep talk.
	•	Comparative Analysis on Demand: Another smart action, “Compare with Last Meeting,” uses AI to outline how the client’s situation and strategy have shifted since the banker’s previous interaction. For instance, the output might be: “Since your last meeting in Feb: Strategy Shift – Client is now emphasizing organic growth over acquisitions, as noted in both the latest earnings call and your Mar 2025 CRM note. New Initiatives – They’ve launched a partner program in APAC (per April news). Follow-up – Last time they requested advice on workflow automation; consider updating them on our new AI tool offering.” This saves the banker time by summarizing evolution over time, and even suggests how to tailor the upcoming conversation.
	•	Ask the AI (GenAI Q&A): A GPT-powered assistant chat is embedded in the interface, allowing the banker to ask ad-hoc questions. The banker could type or ask, “What are the biggest risks mentioned in ServiceNow’s latest filings?” or “Summarize the competitive landscape changes in the last 6 months”. The assistant, aware of the client’s data, would answer in seconds with a concise summary (citing the 10-K or news articles). It can also handle scenario planning queries like, “How might a 1% Fed rate hike impact ServiceNow’s valuation?”, tapping into both market data and the bank’s analyst models to produce a reasoned answer. This interactive Q&A means any last-minute question that pops into the banker’s mind can be addressed on the spot, without frantic manual research.
	•	Next-Best-Action Suggestions: The GenAI co-pilot can proactively surface suggestions for the banker’s meeting approach. For example, based on all the data, it might highlight: “Suggested Talking Point: Competitor X just made a move in this space; consider asking how ServiceNow plans to respond.” Or “Potential Opportunity: Given ServiceNow’s interest in partnerships (from CRM notes), propose a collaboration with our other client in cloud security.” This transforms raw info into strategic advice. In essence, the AI is not only summarizing but also advising, acting as a “coach” for the banker by providing “real-time insights, suggested solutions, and next-best-action strategies during client interactions” ￼.

Design: These dynamic tools could live in a sidebar or top menu for easy access. For instance, a right-side panel might be the “AI Assistant,” where the Q&A chat resides and where generated briefings appear. The Generate 3-Min Briefing and Compare with Last Meeting could be quick action buttons at the top of that panel (with descriptive icons, like a play button for the briefing and a comparison icon for the analysis). When invoked, the results show up within the panel or modal window, which the user can read or listen to. Crucially, the UI should make these GenAI features feel like a natural extension of the workflow – always available but not intrusive. A subtle prompt like “💬 Ask Briefing Assistant…” in a text box can invite the user to interact. By embedding these AI capabilities, the experience becomes GenAI-native rather than an assortment of static reports. The banker essentially has a junior analyst on call 24/7 through the interface.

5. Smart Prep Workflow & Contextual Actions

What it is: Preparing for a client meeting isn’t just about reading information – it involves a series of tasks and collateral. The redesigned system incorporates workflow tools that streamline all prep steps into one place.
	•	Smart Prep Checklist: A context-aware checklist is provided, outlining suggested prep tasks. For example, upon opening the client brief, a checklist might show: “✅ Review Q1 earnings highlights”, “✅ Read last meeting’s notes”, “⬜ Refresh valuation model with new data”, “⬜ Draft intro email to client confirming agenda”. These items can be checked off as completed. The system automatically generates some tasks (like reading earnings or news) and can allow the banker to add custom ones. Each task is linked – clicking “valuation model” opens the model, clicking the earnings item scrolls to the earnings summary section. This ensures the banker doesn’t forget any critical prep element and can visibly track readiness.
	•	“Add to Brief” Actions: Throughout the unified briefing feed, every piece of content has an “Add to Brief” or “Save for Meeting” button. If a banker sees a particular chart or insight they want to mention in the meeting or include in a handout, one click adds it to a temporary briefing clipboard. The user can then compile these into a mini deck or notes document. For instance, after scanning, the banker might click Add to Brief on a revenue chart and a news snippet about a partnership. The system could automatically format these into a one-page PDF or slides which the banker can bring along or email to colleagues. This transforms passive reading into active preparation, letting bankers curate key points for easy reference.
	•	Calendar & Email Integration: The interface is aware of the upcoming meeting (via calendar integration). At the top, it might show: “Client Meeting: May 30 @ 10:00 AM with ServiceNow – Location: HQ Boardroom – Attendees: [Client CEO, CFO, RBC team…]”. This reminds the banker of logistics and participants. An integrated email prep feature can leverage AI to draft emails – for example, a “Pre-meeting Email” template button uses the AI to draft a quick note to the client: “Looking forward to our meeting next week, here are a couple of agenda items…”. (Microsoft’s Meeting Prep app similarly “creates an email draft using summaries of the top topics related to the client” for outreach ￼.) The banker can review/edit and send it right from the dashboard or copy it to Outlook. Post-meeting, the same integration could help draft follow-up emails or log notes, though the focus here is pre-meeting.
	•	Quick Access to Models & Decks: Often bankers need to reference the financial model or past pitchbooks while prepping. The new design provides a “Resources” shortcut area – perhaps a sidebar or top nav – linking directly to relevant files. For example: “📊 Q1 Financial Model (Excel)”, “📑 Last Pitch Deck (PDF)”, “🔗 Deal Pipeline in CRM”. Clicking these either opens them in an integrated viewer or in their native apps. The system knows which files are relevant by context (it might auto-suggest the latest equity research PDF or a recent internal valuation model for ServiceNow). This saves time hunting through folders or emails for attachments. Furthermore, if the banker updates the model with new numbers, the AI could ingest those changes too (keeping the summary in sync with any revised projections).
	•	CRM Task Integration: Any to-dos or reminders related to the client from the CRM (or entered by the banker) are visible in the prep UI. For instance, if last meeting’s notes had “Follow up on acquisition financing options – assigned to [Analyst]”, that task and its status appear. The banker can mark tasks complete or add new ones as outcomes to address after the upcoming meeting. This tight integration means the prep tool doubles as a light CRM front-end – the banker can update notes or create a task (“Discuss market update with client’s treasury team”) from within the briefing interface, and it will sync back to the CRM system.

Design: The workflow and actions could be presented in a collapsible sidebar on the left or right. For example, a left sidebar might be the “Prep Toolkit” containing the checklist at the top, followed by the list of resource links (model, deck, CRM, etc.), and then a section for saved “Briefing snippets” (the collection from Add to Brief actions). Each item is interactive – e.g. checklist items with checkboxes, resource links with file type icons. By having this toolkit docked in the same window, the banker can seamlessly move from reviewing info to taking an action (like editing the model or sending an email) without losing context. It keeps all prep workflow in one environment. This design acknowledges that senior bankers juggle both information gathering and task execution when preparing for a meeting – the new system supports both sides.

6. Client-Impact and Decision Readiness Advantages

This reimagined system isn’t just a tech upgrade – it fundamentally improves how bankers prepare, leading to more impactful client meetings:
	•	Clarity and Focus: By synthesizing mountains of data into an executive-ready brief, the banker enters the meeting with a clear narrative and focus points. They know the client’s current priorities and challenges at a glance. As noted, delivering such actionable insights without excessive detail directly “improves decision-making” ￼. Instead of being overwhelmed, the banker can confidently drive the discussion toward solutions and opportunities that matter to the client.
	•	Proactive Intelligence: GenAI integration means the system doesn’t wait for the banker to dig – it proactively surfaces what to talk about and even suggests how to approach it. This is akin to having an analyst do hours of prep work instantaneously. The banker can explore “what if” questions or get summaries on the fly, which leads to richer conversations with the client. For example, if the client’s CEO casually mentions a competitor’s move, the banker’s AI assistant can quickly feed them relevant intel or talking points in real-time. The banker is never caught flat-footed; the AI co-pilot has their back.
	•	Time Savings and Efficiency: Routine prep tasks (compiling financials, summarizing news, drafting emails) are automated. Bankers reclaim hours that would have been spent piecing information together. This time can be refocused on formulating strategy and client advice. Moreover, the integrated workflow means no more jumping between CRM, email, news terminals, and spreadsheets – reducing cognitive load. Everything needed is one click away, which is critical when senior bankers are multitasking up to the last minute.
	•	Consistency and Knowledge Sharing: The generated brief and highlights can be easily shared with the team (e.g. exportable as a PDF or a live link). Junior team members and partners attending the meeting get the same concise prep, ensuring everyone is on the same page. If something updates (say the client’s stock moves that morning), refreshing the brief updates it for all – creating a consistent source of truth. This reduces the risk of anyone missing an important development. It also helps train junior bankers by example, showing what information is considered key for the client.
	•	Enhanced Client Perception: Ultimately, this intelligent prep translates to tangible client impact. A senior banker armed with this system arrives at the meeting fully informed and ready to discuss strategic issues rather than flipping through notes. Clients will notice that their banking partner is extremely up-to-speed – referencing the latest news, congratulating them on a new hire, or aware of market changes affecting them – without having to be told. The banker can spend more time addressing the client’s needs and proposing solutions (e.g. “We saw your competitor just entered Europe; we have some ideas on how you could counter that…”), demonstrating value. In short, meetings become more about high-level dialogue and less about fact-finding, reinforcing the banker’s role as a trusted advisor.

Conclusion: A Fluid, Contextual, Intelligent Prep Experience

In this reimagined user experience, preparing for a client meeting transforms from a laborious information-gathering exercise into a streamlined, insightful briefing process. By integrating GenAI-driven summarization, proactive analytics, and workflow tools, the system delivers clarity (through succinct summaries), context (by unifying all relevant intel), and actionability (via next-step suggestions and easy task execution). This design mirrors the way senior bankers think – focusing on the big picture and the next decision – while ensuring no detail slips through the cracks. It’s a meeting prep dashboard that thinks and works as hard as the banker, ultimately enabling more informed, strategic, and impactful client engagements.

Sources: The concept draws on emerging best practices in fintech and AI. For example, Microsoft’s Financial Meeting Prep app combines internal/external data and uses an LLM to extract key highlights and news summaries for easy comprehension ￼, underscoring the power of AI in condensing information. Industry analysts note that GenAI can act as a “co-pilot” for relationship managers by providing real-time insights and next-best-action suggestions during client interactions ￼. By harnessing these capabilities, our redesigned experience ensures bankers get the right insights at the right time – delivering a competitive edge in client advisory.
Absolutely. Based on everything we’ve discussed and the screenshot you shared, here’s how you can refine the first-touch experience when a senior banker opens the meeting prep view:

⸻

Goal of First-Touch Output

The first screen should act like an executive chief of staff:
	•	orienting the user on what’s changed,
	•	distilling what matters most now,
	•	and priming them with strategic talking points they can walk into the room with.

This should not feel like a data dump or a recap of widgets—it should feel like someone has already read everything and is giving them the distilled “So What?”.

Refined Structure for the Chat Summary Output (Top Right Panel)

Welcome Back – Here’s What You Need to Know

Since your last meeting with ServiceNow (March 5, 2025):
	•	New development: ServiceNow announced a strategic extension of its AI platform to mid-market clients (April 16).
	•	Earnings update: Q1 revenue grew 20% YoY to $3.005B, driven by enterprise subscription expansion.
	•	Relationship insight: Gina Mastanouco (CFO) expressed interest in streamlining post-Moveworks integration—possible opening for M&A follow-up.

Today’s Talking Points
	1.	AI Monetization Strategy: Ask how the mid-market AI rollout is tracking—are there integration gaps or GTM risks?
	2.	Retention Pressure: Q1 shows 20% churn in low-revenue segments—use this to segue into possible partnership or consolidation ideas.
	3.	Capital Deployment: With $10.3B in subscription backlog, discuss if there’s appetite for targeted acquisition or R&D expansion.

⸻

Design Principles
	•	Brevity over completeness: 3–4 sentences max in the “What Changed” section; 3 sharp bullets for talking points.
	•	Context-aware: Pulls last meeting date from CRM, compares it to earnings/news/events.
	•	Natural language, not structured data: No widget-y labels like “SEC Filings” or “CRM Log.” Speak in banker-readable English.
	•	Visual clarity: Use bold headers (e.g., Earnings update) and subtle icons (e.g., alert, dollar sign, graph) for skimmability.

⸻

Optional Add-ons (Future Iteration Ideas)
	•	“Add to Brief” Suggestions: Each bullet has a [+] icon to add to the PDF/email briefing.
	•	Inline Verbal Preview: “Read this out loud to me” audio button for car/train prep.
	•	Tailor to Meeting Type: If it’s a CEO vs CFO meeting, slightly shift the talking point emphasis (e.g., growth vs margin).

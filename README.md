Over the past two quarters, ServiceNow has implemented a series of cost-optimization strategies aimed at preserving operating leverage amid slower enterprise IT spending:

Headcount Rationalization:

Reduced hiring across non-core functions

Streamlined layers in GTM and customer success teams

Estimated $48M in annualized savings

Cloud Infrastructure Optimization:

Shifted to multi-cloud orchestration to avoid vendor lock-in

Re-negotiated long-term commitments with hyperscalers

Realized ~150 bps improvement in gross margin QoQ

Vendor Consolidation & Real Estate Strategy:

Reduced real estate footprint by 22%

Centralized procurement with fewer SaaS and consulting vendors

Result:
Operating margin expanded from 23.9% to 26.4% YoY, with the CFO citing “disciplined execution” and “digital-first selling efficiency” as drivers.

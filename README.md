Hi team,

Thanks again for pulling together the discussion guide for our upcoming interview with RBC bankers. I’ve had a chance to review the list, and it’s great to see how much ground we’re aiming to cover.

Given that we’ll only have around one hour with each participant, I thought it might be helpful for us to regroup and reflect on a few things together before we go in:

Prioritization: With 45 questions across multiple themes, can we quickly identify the 8–10 highest priority questions we want to be sure to cover in the time available?

Clarity & Framing: A few of the questions could benefit from tighter framing so that we can avoid hypotheticals or overly open-ended prompts and instead anchor more on real examples, behaviors, and past decisions.
  Example: Question 45 – “What do you feel will be the most valuable area to leverage GenAI in your client services work?”
This could be reframed to something more behavioral and grounded, e.g., “Have you ever tried using GenAI in your client services workflow? What happened?”

AI-Specific Prompts: For the GenAI-related section, perhaps we can flag what we most want to learn (e.g., trust, usability, perceived value), so we don’t over-index on tooling questions without context.
Example: Question 35 – “Would you use a tool that helps generate a first draft of a deck?”
Before asking this, should we first understand whether they trust automated outputs in general (as in Q42)? That may help us frame this better and avoid abstract speculation.

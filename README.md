Perfect — I see what you’re aiming for: a crisp but compelling note to Mike, not a manifesto. Something that starts simple, frames the “three games” cleanly, and lands on the need for alignment. Here’s a draft you can use (or tweak):

Subject: Clarifying the “Game” for Aiden Banker

Hi Mike,

Yesterday in our scrum call, it felt like we were implicitly assuming that engagement is what we should optimize for. I want to present a contrary argument.

At its core, product strategy is about knowing what game you’re playing and how you keep score. How else would we know if we’re actually winning?

In the digital world, you’re usually playing one of three games:
	1.	Engagement Game – success = maximizing time spent and frequency of use (social, media, gaming).
	2.	Transaction Game – success = frictionless commerce and purchase confidence (e-commerce, marketplaces).
	3.	Productivity Game – success = helping users get critical work done faster, more reliably, and with higher quality (B2B, workflow tools).

My view: Aiden Banker is a Productivity product.
	•	Our users (bankers) have extremely high opportunity cost; time saved is the currency.
	•	Engagement still matters — but only as a leading indicator that users trust the tool enough to make it a habit.
	•	Optimizing for Productivity means our true “scoreboard” is things like: % of meetings prepped with Aiden, average prep time saved, quality/trust of briefs — not time spent in-app.

I think getting alignment on which game we’re playing is critical before we fine-tune metrics or roadmap. If we’re all clear that Aiden Banker is a Productivity game, then our north star, KPIs, and even design choices will look very different from if we chase Engagement.

Happy to walk through this in more detail, but I wanted to surface it early so we can get on the same page.

Best,
[Your Name]

This email is short, principle-driven, and leaves space for discussion.

Do you want me to also draft a slightly longer follow-up deck-style note (1-pager with the three games side by side + proposed scoreboard for Aiden) that you could share after Mike responds? That way you don’t overload the first email, but you’re ready with substance if he asks.

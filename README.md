 recommend considering Granola AI as a note-taking tool for our investment banking team. It allows bankers to jot down key points during client meetings, and then enhances these notes post-meeting by adding context and organizing them into structured summaries. Granola operates discreetly without joining meetings as a bot, ensuring a seamless experience. Its integration with calendars and customizable templates further streamline the note-taking process. This tool could help our team stay engaged during meetings while ensuring accurate and organized documentation.
